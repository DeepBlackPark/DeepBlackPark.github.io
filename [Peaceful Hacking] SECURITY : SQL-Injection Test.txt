[Peaceful Hacking] SECURITY : SQL-Injection Test

SECURITY is VERY IMPORTDENT thing on this days
so I started to run it.

Today, I'll run about SQL-injection (DB-SECURITY)

as namuwiki : https://namu.wiki/w/SQL injection

We can try it 3 ways

1. UI SQL EVAL : Login Form
if login form is programmed like `SELECT user FROM user_table WHERE id='ID that user input' AND password='[PW that user Input]'; (Actually, PW is change to hash(SHA), WARNING : this code is dangerous, user can input SQL)
At `MySQL`, check ' A ", and If it raise Error, then can be inject SQL.

2. User HTTP.
at HTTP header, They'll tell you their Server Version and Server System Name.

3. Blind SQL (Actually, I'm not Haker, I don't know How to do it)

Let's Try it test.
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=SQL (or https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/?q=SQL+injection+Test+Page&ia=web) search injection Test Page (I test it on tor.)

https://ashkiani.github.io/sql-injection-playground/ I used this site.

Let's input pw as `' OR '1' = '1`
by admin account

umm this site is too difficult.

I've just start it just 1 minute ago.

try it to search "login admin.asp"

"https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/?t=h_&q=login+admin.asp"

I don't now what to do...

well
`nothin' or '1'='1` is it work?

well, now you can be check you'r DB yourself, maybe, I'll come back by "SECURITY : SQL-Injection Test - 2"
